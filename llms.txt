# llms-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes the `llms.txt` file from your project root as a resource for AI context enhancement.

## Overview

llms-mcp is a focused MCP server that looks for the `llms.txt` file in the root of your project directory and exposes it as a resource that can be consumed by MCP-compatible AI clients, based on the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) proposed standard.

## Features

- **Detection**: Finds the `llms.txt` file in your project root
- **File Resource**: Exposes the file via `file://` URI for direct content access
- **Parsing**: Extracts local file references and external URLs from llms.txt content. Automatically exposes referenced local files and external URLs as additional MCP resources.
- **Fetching**: Can fetch external resources on-demand.

## Technical Overview

See [README](file://./readme.md) for detailed implementation information.
